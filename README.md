# Own-Command-Shell

This project is about implementing your own command shell - much like csh, bsh or the DOS command shell. 

It will include the following customized commands:

shell*: which will a list of custom commands
Exit*: print a list of the team all members, then it will wait for the user to hit the “return” key to terminate the shell and return the control to the original shell program on your machine
History* : view the last 5 executed commands.
cd*: move to the parent directory of current directory, and print the current path ( i.e. equivalent to cd .. + pwd).
clear*:  clear the terminal screen and print the list of directory and files in the current directory (i.e. equivalent  to clear + ls).
